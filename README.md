# startup
Th idea for my start up is a simple poll taking page. It will allow a user to create a question, put in 2-6 answers listed A-F and get people to answer the question. After people have started answering the question both the person who made the question and the people who have answered will be able to see the distribution of answers. The distribution will be formatted into a bar chart that will be easy to read and visually appealling. 

CSS needs to link with the corresponding parts in the html file. You can create a class in css that you can repeatedly use for parts of the html file. There is a lot that you can do with CSS so it is important to keep learning and looking things up as I go along.
